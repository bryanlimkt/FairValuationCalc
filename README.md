# FairValuationCalc
This program takes in the ticker symbol of a company and returns its fair valuation, as well as ideal purchase price assuming a 50% margin of safety

# Introduction
Calculating a company's valuation is crucial for value investing, the type of investment strategy used by billionaire Warren Buffet. However, unless you are subscribed to an advanced (and expensive) financial application, it is often a manual process to calculate whether a company is undervalued, overvalued or reasonably priced. Most information is found on the web (in this case, YAHOO! Finance). This project was done with the aim to automate data collection, and return the fair valuation of a company within second, without the need to even open up your web browser.

# Appendix
The method used to calculate fair valuation was described in the video below:
